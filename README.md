# Proxy-Inspector
The Proxy Inspector is an advanced and feature-rich Python Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool meticulously engineered to provide comprehensive and accurate assessments of proxy validity and anonymity. Leveraging the robustness of Python, this tool sets itself apart from conventional proxy checkers, offering sophisticated functionalities that cater to the discerning needs of tech-savvy users.

Through its seamless integration with the "requests" library, the Proxy Inspector efficiently verifies the integrity of a user-provided list of proxies. Employing meticulous HTTP requests to the authoritative domain "https://httpbin.org/ip," it rigorously evaluates the responsiveness and legitimacy of each proxy. Proxies that successfully respond to the request are identified as valid, while those that fail to meet the criteria are swiftly excluded from further consideration.

Intriguingly, the Proxy Inspector goes beyond mere validity checks and delves into the realm of anonymity. With an astute analysis of the client IP address and the proxy IP address, it unearths crucial insights. When the client IP address diverges from the proxy IP address, the tool classifies the proxy as "anonymous," indicating its ability to shield the true identity of the client.

The Proxy Inspector stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern Python programming, exemplifying the sophistication and depth that can be achieved in developing tools for network analysis. Its clean and well-structured codebase ensures ease of maintenance and extensibility, while its comprehensive documentation empowers users with the knowledge to harness its capabilities effectively.

By empowering users with accurate and actionable data, the Proxy Inspector embodies the spirit of professionalism and precision, making it an indispensable tool for network administrators, cybersecurity experts, and developers seeking to navigate the intricate landscape of proxy verification.

# proxies.txt file

Along with the Proxy Inspector tool, a text file (.txt) is provided, comprising a substantial collection of more than 5000 proxies, available for testing purposes. While this file has not undergone exhaustive testing, it's nonetheless complete and offers a starting point for users to initiate their proxy verification process. This file serves as a valuable resource for users to expedite their evaluation of various proxies. 

It is essential to note that while the provided file is beneficial, users are encouraged to exercise caution and conduct their due diligence in verifying the authenticity and reliability of the proxies listed. 
For utmost control and flexibility, the file can and must be  customized to incorporate user-specific proxies for comprehensive and tailored testing (so if a user wants to test their own proxies, they must modify the proxies.txt and add them to the file)
